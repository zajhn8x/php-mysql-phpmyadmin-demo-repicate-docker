==============================
Synergy with Vagrant Docker VM
==============================

The [Vagrant Docker VM](https://github.com/webdevops/vagrant-docker-vm) (Ubuntu 16.04) is using
[dinghy docker](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy) for providing an automatic and dynamic reverse proxy
which makes easy to start multiple instances of the boilerplate.

You can also use [dinghy docker](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy) standalone if you don't need
an full Linux environment.
